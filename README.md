# Noskcah Portfolio

A concept portfolio inspired by immersive, animation-forward freelance design sites. The landing
experience greets visitors in multiple languages before revealing the main content.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file or start a local HTTP server) to explore the
prototype.

### Development tips
- `styles/main.css` contains the layout, typography, and animation system.
- `scripts/main.js` powers the multilingual greeting overlay, smooth scrolling, and section reveal
  animations.

Feel free to remix the copy, palette, and layout to match your voice.
